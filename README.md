### Rules

**You only have one life** and you're surrounded by monsters. Stay alive is your only goal so be sure to never be touched by any monster. Oh and if you need them, some bonuses will pop on the floor, just walk on it to pick one. *Be carefull, a legend say that some bonuses are in fact maluses...*

Move with keyboard arrows, fire with mouse click.
